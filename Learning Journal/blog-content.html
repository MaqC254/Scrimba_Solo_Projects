        <h2>My new journey as a bootcamp student</h2>
        <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made
            the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects 
            and meet like minded peers
        </p>

        <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
        <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours 
            learning, then try to create simple projects using what I had learnt or work new 
            techniques into existing projects.
        </p>
        <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning 
            and most things about my journey with the world.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How I got started
        </h3>
        <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes. 
            After each lesson I would us my notes to not only reflect on what I had learnt but 
            also write short summaries of what I had learnt using my own words.
        </p>
        <p>That helped grok what I was learning, and I realised that posting my learning 
            summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated
